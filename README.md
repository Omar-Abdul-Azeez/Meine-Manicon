# Meine Manicon
Add cover art from Anilist as folder icons to your Anime collection. This is a fork of [dedsec](https://github.com/notdedsec)'s [anicon](https://github.com/notdedsec/anicon).

### Why use this fork?
Well... don't. ~But you can just use it if you want to use Anilist instead of MAL.~
-Dropped some features to prioritize automation.

### How do I use this?

There is no releases of this fork yet so you'll have to have Python installed on your system.

- Download `manicon.py`
- Run it in your Anime folder (contains folders for each anime)
- ~Choose when you're asked to~ Choose no more! everything is internally handled. At the cost of some accuracy

### Okay so i did everything, but the icons aren't showing up. (*panicks*)
Your PC may take some time to index those icons. They should show up in 2 to 5 minutes. I guess. You can also go into each folder and move the `desktop.ini` file out of the folder then put it back again. or just restart your PC...

### Alright. It works but I can see that accuracy cost you were talking about...
Well... You can open `manicon.py` then fix my code for me... It's such a rare occurence that editing the code to force a specific anime repetitively is not worth a code fix.

### I don't like these icons. How do i remove them?
Delete the 'Cover' folder as well as the '.ico' and 'desktop.ini' files. These files are hidden so make sure you have `Show Hidden Items` option ticked. You can just search and delete them all if you wanna batch remove all icons. But why would you wanna do that anyway?

### I was promised memes. Gib memes.
Alright here you go.
